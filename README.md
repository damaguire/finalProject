# CA-FinalProject
 My Final Project

# Installation

You must first install Meteor to use this repository (sorry)

```curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh ```

After installing Meteor you can clone the repo and install the necessary packages

```meteor npm install --save semantic-ui-react ethereumjs-util react-router-dom semantic-ui-css react-router history web3```

Once those are installed you can run the following command to boot meteor

```meteor```

Once meteor is booted (assuming no errors) you should be able to navigate to the following url to see the project:

```localhost:3000```
